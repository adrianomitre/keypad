* Do the same Keypad -> keypad as Cartesian -> cartesian,
  including a last Keypad version which includes a dependency to keypad.

* Create the keypad site and change the link in the first section of README.rdoc (= cartesian)

* Mention in the docs (History, README) the new, efficient Keypad.words implementation,
  that accepts a block when no pre-computation of the whole cartesian array is wanted.
